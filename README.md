Partition Supervisor across nodes in a cluster.

We send a message.
Params -> city, some value.

At the end I want cumulative data.

city data goes in one supervisor.

## Instructions

```
cd Split
iex -S mix
iex(1)> Split.run_supervised
```


## Additional Example.
The Partition Supervisor example is made in refernce to example by Alex Koutomos. [code][https://github.com/BeamBasket/beam_basket_talk]
The Aim of participation is to try to create a Partition Supervisor that runs across nodes in cluster. If the Steps below are incomplete, then this example needs more time.


## Steps
[x] Implement Partition Supervisor on single Node
[ ] Create a cluster of nodes
[ ] Test sending message across nodes. connect nodes by pg or global or whatever.
[ ] Implement Partition Supervisor in a way that partitions run on different Nodes.
